# Mastermind

This project aims to replicate the classic board game [Mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game))
Sample code provided in Java language.

You are the player.

## How to use

- `mvn install && java -jar target/mastermind-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`
- give answers through STDIN + ENTER key to validate.
  Use **R**ed **J**=Yellow, **B**lue, **O**range, **V**=Green, **N**=Black.
- win ðŸ˜Ž !

## Bonus: Running & Debugging on VSCode

I used this project as a Test Drive for Java support on **Visual Studo Code**.

I used these extensions:

- Language Support for Java by RedHat,
- Debugger for Java,
- Java Test Runner,

For Lombok support, I had to tweak my config:

```json
  "java.jdt.ls.vmargs":
    "-javaagent:/path/to/.m2/repository/org/projectlombok/lombok/1.16.18/lombok-1.16.18.jar -Xbootclasspath/a:/path/to/.m2/repository/org/projectlombok/lombok/1.16.18/lombok-1.16.18.jar",
```

After that VSCode was able to correctly pick up `@Getter`, `@Setter`, etc.

Then, to debug:

- `mvn -Dmaven.surefire.debug test`
- Then use the `Debug (Attach)` launch configuration in Visual Studio Code to debug step by step.

Or use the integrated terminal window and run maven commands.

## Future

In the future I will add auto-play to try the **Five-guess algorithm** and the **Genetic Algorithm**
